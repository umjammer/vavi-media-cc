1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,900
- Mothers Day today, and I
want to talk about mothers,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,870
but actually I want to
talk more about women

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,980
in general this morning.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,683
And I want to kind of
lead up with a movie.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,140
I don't know, old timers
might remember this movie.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,907
Remember the movie, "Pretty Woman?"

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,800
Was she ever that young (laughing)?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,830
Julia Roberts, remember her?

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,880
Launched her career in this movie.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,740
Roberts plays the part of a prostitute,

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,983
but, she's a prostitute with a good heart.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,410
A prostitute with a good heart.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,530
And in this movie, if
you've never seen it,

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,630
Richard Gere, the other
co-star in the movie,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,080
he's a lonely but rich business man

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,410
that buys her services for a night,

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,477
but he ends up falling in love with her.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,540
We fast forward to the end of this movie,

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,260
and the end of the movie
has a happy ending.

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,410
It finishes on the fire escape here.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,993
Happy ending for these two people.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,100
Now in the story, we find
out that Richard Gere,

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,390
you know, is rich.

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,880
He can buy fancy clothes.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,870
He can buy cars.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,790
He can buy beauty.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,370
He can buy sex.

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,720
But the thing that draws him
to Julia Roberts's character

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,010
is that she's honest
with him about himself,

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,163
and not just that she's a pretty woman.

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,720
That's where the title
comes in, "Pretty Woman."

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,723
She's not just a pretty woman.

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,090
She has a good heart.

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,180
She has an honest heart.

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,440
And this is, of course,
the hook in the movie.

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,713
He loves her for her
heart, not just her body.

37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,960
This basically, of course,
is the charm of the movie,

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,283
and the message that so
many women have bought into.

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,440
The message being, be
beautiful and desirable

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,363
on the outside, and be good on the inside.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,320
This pretty woman concept and combination

42
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,510
is promoted in the world as a guarantee

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,830
to popularity, and happiness,
and good self-esteem,

44
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,790
and boyfriends, boyfriends.

45
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,090
It also sells a lot of makeup and jeans,

46
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,373
and things like that.

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,680
Of course, this desirable-on-the-outside,

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,290
good-on-the-inside ideal
works in the movies

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,263
and in magazines, but it's not
how the real world operates.

50
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,230
In the real world, we
see that hardly anyone,

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,320
especially guys, ever get
past the physical outside

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,940
part of a girl in order to bother

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,810
discovering the true inner goodness.

54
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,990
And you say, "Why is that?"

55
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,030
Well because men, in the world certainly,

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,673
are more interested in sex than
goodness for the most part.

57
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay, there are
exceptions, but we all know

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,290
that even the good guys have to struggle

59
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,990
to get past just seeing the
physical side of a woman,

60
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,070
and most guys, again, in the world,

61
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,050
just stop right there
and don't go any further.

62
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,713
So what's a girl to do?

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,880
So much pressure from TV, and from movies,

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,250
from my girlfriends, from guys,

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,760
from my own desire to
be noticed, to be liked,

66
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,873
to be loved, to be popular.

67
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,223
You know what I think?

68
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,030
I think that it's about
time that Christian women

69
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,993
of all ages started a revolution.

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,380
I say, it's about time Christian women

71
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,393
did something more than
just try to be pretty.

72
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,150
I say, it's about time
women became radicalized

73
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,210
about being Christians,
and started a movement

74
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,713
that created a true shift
in thinking about gender,

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,783
and what it means to
be a Christian female,

76
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,000
a Christian woman, in the 21st century.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,350
I say that the time is
overdue for a seismic shift

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,640
in how women of faith think
and conduct themselves

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,640
so that their true power
can be felt in society.

80
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,500
Now, don't get me wrong.

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm not talking about the
tired old neo-feminist battle

82
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,650
for women to serve communion,
or preach from the pulpit,

83
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,610
or serve as elders.

84
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,993
I'm not talking about that.

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,580
I'm talking about a
complete paradigm shift

86
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,390
for the way Christian women
see and project themselves

87
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,093
in the post-modern world.

88
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,240
Sisters, you're being programmed

89
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,360
by the pretty woman
manipulators to be beautiful

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,270
and desirable on the outside,

91
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,450
and good and innocent on the inside.

92
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,750
I say, turn the world upside
down in your generation

93
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,860
by going back to the way
that God created you to be.

94
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,947
And that is, good on
the outside (chuckles).

95
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,263
Good on the outside.

96
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,530
Paul writes, "Likewise, I want women,"

97
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,317
and he's talking about Christian women,

98
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,467
"I want women to adorn
themselves with proper clothing,

99
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:22,127
"modestly and discreetly,
not with braided hair

100
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,307
"and gold or pearls or costly garments,

101
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,427
"but rather by means of good works,

102
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:31,190
"as is proper for women
making a claim to godliness."

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,540
Good on the outside.

104
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,247
Paul is saying, "Cover
yourselves with good works,

105
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:41,540
"with goodness, with modesty."

106
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,540
This is the outside cover of
a dynamic Christian woman.

107
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,353
Now, don't get me wrong.

108
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:52,780
It's okay to wear nice
clothes or jewelry, makeup.

109
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,000
But the thing that people
notice are your good works.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,760
The thing that makes you
stand out is your kindness.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,990
Now going back to the
way that God created you

112
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,990
means also, that you're
beautiful in the inside.

113
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:13,817
1 Peter 3, Peter says, "Your adornment

114
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:17,977
"must not be merely
external, braiding the hair

115
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,407
"and wearing gold jewelry,
or putting on dresses,

116
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,127
"but let it be the hidden
person of the heart,

117
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,247
"with the imperishable quality of a gentle

118
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,277
"and quiet spirit, which is precious

119
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:30,530
"in the sight of God."

120
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,623
Good on the outside.

121
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,890
Beautiful on the inside.

122
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,890
And then thirdly,
desirable in the intimacy

123
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,963
of your marriage bed.

124
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,687
Solomon says, "Rejoice in
the wife of your youth,

125
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:53,147
"let her breasts satisfy you at all times,

126
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:58,147
"be exhilarated always with her love."

127
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,483
There is a time to be appealing sexually.

128
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,050
God says it's when you become one

129
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,350
with your partner in
marriage, with your husband,

130
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,973
and nowhere else.

131
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,930
There's no call for you to be desirable

132
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,673
to any other man than your husband.

133
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,360
Good on the outside.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,190
Beautiful on the inside.

135
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,400
Desirable in the unity of marriage.

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,080
If you begin this revolution,
here's what's going to happen.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,760
Number one, you will break free

138
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,020
of the slavish control of your bodies

139
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,160
by corporate America, and Hollywood,

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,313
and social media.

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,520
You will once again be in charge of you,

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,250
and out of competition with other women,

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,190
and the impossible
ideal dangled before you

144
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,480
by those imposters who parade around

145
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,123
as gurus of what you should look like.

146
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,310
Full partnership, true gender justice,

147
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,920
comes only when you are free

148
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,223
from the false image makers.

149
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,210
Good on the outside, unleashes the power

150
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,703
of God's goodness through
you onto the world.

151
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,830
Another thing that will
happen in this revolution.

152
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,210
Beautiful on the inside will
bring peace and security

153
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,200
for your soul.

154
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,130
You see, the true feminine mystique

155
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,850
is only found in the unique nature

156
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,010
of a women's inner beauty.

157
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,300
No spirituality is as
complex and influential

158
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,000
as the power emanating from the heart

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,263
of a Christian woman.

160
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,370
A woman has not reached her true potential

161
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,560
until she has begun to cultivate

162
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,180
the depths of her inner
beauty in Christ Jesus.

163
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,210
You see, you're potential is not that you

164
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,530
become as good or successful as men,

165
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,243
but that you reach your
potential as Christians.

166
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,813
There's the key.

167
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,730
And then finally, the
revolution will achieve

168
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,510
what this world and it's
lord want so badly to avoid,

169
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,470
and that is it'll put human sexuality

170
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,650
back into the exclusive
confines of marriage

171
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,450
where it belongs.

172
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,563
Sexuality doesn't belong on a billboard.

173
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,450
It doesn't belong in a magazine.

174
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,040
It doesn't even belong in a movie.

175
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,480
It only belongs in the marriage bed.

176
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,593
That's the only place for it.

177
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,910
Sisters, here are some truths that come

178
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,220
from someone who has
been counseling people

179
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,870
about sexual matters for 40 years,

180
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,050
some basic truth that
you learn after a time.

181
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,490
Truth number one.

182
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,450
The more you preserve
your sexual integrity,

183
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,800
the less pain you will
experience as a single woman,

184
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,753
if you're single.

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,440
The more you preserve
your sexual integrity,

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,563
the less pain, nevermind about morality,

187
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,223
the less pain that you
will experience as a woman.

188
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,420
Truth number two, the more you preserve

189
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,320
your sexual self, the more precious

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,633
this gift will be to your husband.

191
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,173
And truth number three.

192
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,780
The greater your sexual
fidelity in marriage,

193
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,690
the greater potential you have

194
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,460
for a satisfying and
joy-filled sexual experience

195
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,110
within that marriage.

196
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,790
Your precious secret is the
discovery and revelation

197
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,520
of your sexual self to another.

198
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,640
When done within
marriage, it is the source

199
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,620
of endless delight, which
is exactly what Solomon

200
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,570
is saying in the passage
I just read to you

201
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,460
a few moments ago.

202
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,340
Now, I know some of you,
not hearing what I'm saying.

203
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Maybe you don't get it.

204
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,173
Maybe you don't care.

205
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,297
Maybe you just want
church to end (chuckles).

206
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,853
But maybe some of you
like being a pretty woman.

207
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,270
But for those of you who hear me,

208
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,883
this revolution belongs to you.

209
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,220
Don't pay attention to the
smallness of the crowd,

210
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,480
or the awkwardness of the day

211
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,043
because of social distancing.

212
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,960
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

213
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,037
Jesus said the following.

214
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:43,187
"He presented another
parable to them saying,

215
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,627
"'The kingdom of heaven
is like a mustard seed,

216
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,607
"'which a man took and sowed in his field;

217
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,227
"'and this is smaller
than all other seeds,

218
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,987
"'but when it is full grown, it is larger

219
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,407
"'than the garden plants
and becomes a tree,

220
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,564
"'so that the birds of the air come

221
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:03,330
"'and nest in its branches.'"

222
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,330
If you get it, if you want
it, you can be that seed,

223
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,950
and begin the revolution
right here, right now,

224
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,980
today even, in this very place.

225
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,740
One day long from now,
you'll remember that

226
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,200
this is the day that you left

227
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,943
the pretty woman complex behind,

228
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,473
and rather reached out
to become a holy woman,

229
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,630
pleasing to God, precious to man,

230
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,483
and at peace with yourself.

231
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,310
I pray that God blesses you, my sisters,

232
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,990
and I sincerely wish
you a happy Mothers Day

233
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,610
to all of those who have had
that wonderful experience.

234
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,960
In closing, let me extend an invitation

235
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,120
to those women and men who have not yet

236
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,350
given their lives to Christ to do this

237
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,930
by expressing your faith in
repentance and in baptism.

238
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,170
And I encourage you to do this now.

239
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,870
Another thing that has always
been ready is the water.

240
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,860
The church spent the
money to get a plumber

241
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,720
to fix the water, to make
sure the water's always ready,

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,450
in season, out of season,
the water is always ready,

243
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,110
for those who wish to come to Christ

244
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,800
and express their faith
in repentance and baptism.

245
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,450
And of course, those who need prayer

246
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,740
to be better Christian women,
better Christian mothers,

247
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,330
better Christian men,
better Christian fathers,

248
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,140
the church, the elders, are here always

249
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,760
to pray for your needs.

250
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,320
So if anyone has a need at this time,

251
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
we encourage you to make that need known

252
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,933
as we stand and as we sing
our song of encouragement.
